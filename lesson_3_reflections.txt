When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want to share with someone but I do not want to share everything, I can specify which branch is shared when doing this remotely. If my PC crashes I have some sort of backup with all the history stored elsewhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You can work in a forest this way. And only sync when you get back to the grid. Also not every commit needs to be immediately seen by others, they can be grouped for efficiency. I'd like to see what's changed by the others then I do a manual pull. Automatic pull would probably hide this from me.
